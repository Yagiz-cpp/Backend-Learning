# Backend-Learning
A focused backend service that lets users register, authenticate, browse a movie catalog, and build a personal watchlist with statuses, ratings, and notes. It is structured as a clean REST API with modular routes, controllers, and middleware, and is designed to be easy to extend with additional endpoints or business rules.
